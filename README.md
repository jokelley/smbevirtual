<p class="p1">Science is an international endeavor! To promote equity and inclusion, SMBE is excited to announce a Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program! The goal of the program is to promote the exchange of ideas between labs with different academic cultures and make explicit efforts to connect faculty and students in the Molecular Biology and Evolution community across the globe. This program helps mentees develop an international supportive network, provides a pathway for future success, and broadens their knowledge in our field. Since many lab meetings have a virtual component, we thought this is an excellent time to take advantage of these unusual circumstances with a training program.</p>
In this program, SMBE seeks to provide training to students at the graduate or early postdoctoral level (“mentees”) by participating in lab meetings of a research group that shares their interests. The mentee will participate by attending lab meetings during 2022-2023. A designated “mentor” from the research group will dedicate portions of two lab meetings to the mentee’s professional development. The format for lab meetings dedicated to the mentee’s professional development is flexible, but could take the form of grant application statements, research presentation, lead paper discussion, etc.
<h3 id="the-following-are-requirements-for-program-completion">The following are requirements for program completion:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Attendance at 10 lab meetings with portions of 2 lab meetings dedicated to mentee’s professional development before June 2023 (we envision this is approximately 10-20 hours of time total, depending on lab meeting lengths)</li>
 	<li>
<p class="p1">Bi-monthly participation in professional development discussions in a virtual forum</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stipend">Stipend</h3>
Approved applicants will receive a $100 stipend (see information on eligibility and number of stipends available below).
